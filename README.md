# solar_map_web
jquery/bootstrap app to control special functions of my esp8266 solor map (see [https://github.com/marcwingduck/solar_map]).
Basically it consists of an authentification form, color pickers, hacky brightness sliders and buttons that grab the chosen colors and execute the code they are labeled with.

The page is online at [http://solar.marclieser.de/].
